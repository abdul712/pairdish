## Current Status
- **Completed**: Infrastructure, backend, basic frontend, and data import tools
- **In Progress**: CSV data import and AI content generation
- **Next Steps**: Process CSV data and enhance frontend features

## Key Files & Locations
- **Backend**: `/src/index.ts`
- **Database Schema**: `/schema.sql`
- **Frontend**: `/frontend/`
- **Data Import**: `/scraper/`
  - `ai_generator.py` - Main AI content generator
  - `master_dishes.csv` - Master dish list (to be added)
- **Documentation**: 
  - `/README.md` - Project overview
  - `/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Setup instructions
  - `/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - This file

## Data Format for CSV
Expected CSV format:
```csv
keyword,main_dish,side_dish_1,side_dish_2,side_dish_3,...,side_dish_15
"what to serve with beef wellington","Beef Wellington","Roasted Potatoes","Yorkshire Pudding",...
```

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Receive CSV file with master dish list
2. Create CSV parser in ai_generator.py
3. Process and import all dish data
4. Test all API endpoints with new data
5. Enhance frontend with filtering and search features

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100+ main dishes with pairings imported
- [ ] <3s page load time
- [ ] 90+ PageSpeed score
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] SEO-optimized for all pages
- [ ] Zero runtime errors in production

## Notes
- All API endpoints are live at: https://pairdish.mabdulrahim.workers.dev
- Database currently contains 32 main dishes and 393 total dishes
- KV caching is configured for 1-hour TTL on pairing queries
- Frontend needs deployment platform selection
